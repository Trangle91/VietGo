            <p class='modau'>
Ha Noi capital, in my opinion, is very peaceful and beautiful. This used to be one of my summer treats every year when I was little.
I had tried a lot of food and experienced Ha noi as a real local. I spoke their accent, and excitedly enjoyed their food. It has been 
ten years that I have not traveled there, but it always remains a gently loving image in my childhood memories. 
Let's dive into the charming old quarter.
            </p>
<div id='tips'>

<!--   <h3>Before the trip</h3> -->   

<h2>Before the trip</h2>

    <h3 id='language'>Language</h3>
    There are pools of English centers and interntional schools so people speak fluent English here. Yet, official language 
    is Vietnamese, so unless you explicitly ask them, they would not speak English.
   
    <h3 id='weather'>Weather</h3>

    Apparently, there are merely dry and rainy seasons in Hue, and hot weather in Saigon. In Hanoi, the weather begins to be
    more distinctly partitioned into four seasons. It is very humid in the Winter and Spring. Normally, it varies around 
    50-ish fahrenheit degrees, but it gets really frigid just like Minnesota cold because of it humidity. 
    
    <h3 id='visitingTime'>Best time to visit</h3>
    
    Fall is incredibly beautiful here, so the best time to travel is from August to November. It would be a bit chilly sometimes
    but in general, it is pretty charming and comfy to explore the city. The typical rainy days in summer sluggishly
    halts, displaced by its cousin - Fall, so the old quarter is rising and waving its allure. March to May is also a good time to 
    wander. It is like waking up after the hibernation making it more historic and attractive.


    <h3 id='currency'>Currency</h3>

    The currency is Vietnam dong. You will need to exchange cash prior to your arrival. Cards of any kind will not be 
    accepted except in some places like hotels. You would not want to use US dollars because if you purchase something
    for only couple cents, you would not get back the change, so better have Vietnamese dongs in your purse.

<h2>Arrival</h2>   

    If you arrive by air planes, Noi Bai international airport will be welcoming you. It is the biggest airport in VN, yet
    not as busy as Saigon's Tan Son Nhat airport. Noi Bai is 19 miles away from the city. You can catch a taxi for $25 one way,
     or an airport bus for $3 to go into the city. 

    <br>Tips: if you are taking a taxi, make sure to ask for estimated price before hand. Some people will ask for double
    after you get off.
    
    will be in the center of the city, so it is quite easy and affordable to 
    grab a regular taxi or a GrabBike to get to the hotel or to your place. Uber is not a common choice. We have an 
    alternative called GrabBike, and it is somewhat cheaper than a regular taxi. 

    <br>If you arrive by train, depends on where you depart that the ticket will vary, you will be landing in Ha Noi gas station.
    It is a big one and locates right in the center of the city. It will take you a day or even more to travel, the ticket is also
    somewhat the same as the budget airfair, but you will see the appealing landscape along the way.

    <br>If you arrive by bus, Mai Linh and Hoang Long are the biggest bus service to travel up North. You can ask any aggency
    for a ticket with $50. The buses normally depart at 6 p.m. every day. Typically, it will take 24 hours to travel from Saigon, and 13 hours from either Hue or Da nang to Ha noi.

    <h3 id='accommodation'>Accommodations</h3>

    There are plenty of hotels all over the city. If you stay with Airbnb, stick around the central areas such as 
    The Old Quarter, Hoan Kiem District, Dong Da District. If you are looking out for a good hotel, I would suggest
    looking at: 
    <ul>
        <li><a class='hotel' href='https://www.agoda.com/melia-hanoi-hotel/hotel/hanoi-vn.html?cid=1723698' target="_blank">Melia Hanoi Hotel</a>($200-$300) 44B Ly Thuong Kiet Street, Hoan Kiem District</li>

    </ul>
    
    
    <h3 id='trans'>Transportations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>By feet: you can easily walk around Hanoi while rejoicing with the noisy old quarter and daily life of the locals.
    I really enjoyed walking when I was there. It would be easier because the streets were always filled with cars and scooters.
  </li>
      <li> Scooters: Hanoi is the second biggest city so you will doubtlessly be overwhelmed by the traffic as well. It is the main means
        of transportation. If you want to rent a scooter, it can be through the tourist agency or can be through a local business on a street.
        The price varies from $2 to $10 a day depending on what kind of scooter it is.
        
         </li> 
          
       <li> Taxi/GrabBike: This is also a good choice. Though a taxi driver would likely drive you around with a charge for longer route.
        </li>
       <li> Double decker buses: from $15 and up. It is new in Hanoi recently.They operate daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and have 
         wide routes. </li>

        <li>Public metros/Buses: The system is more developed than in Saigon. Local people take buses to go to work in the morning.

    <h4><a class='places' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_Mausoleum'>Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum </a></h4>

<p>For many Vietnamese people, the complex of Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum is a special place to pay a respect to the Hero of
   Vietnam – President Ho Chi Minh. Located to the west of the Hanoi’s Old Quarter, the complex comprises botanical 
   gardens, monuments, memori­als and pagodas, which are usually crowded with groups of all ages, from all over the 
   nation.


<br> Visiting the mausoleum, you should dress modestly and maintain a respectful demeanor at all times as wearing
shorts and tank tops is not permitted there. You are also advised to avoid putting your hands in pockets as well 
as to take of hats and leave your cameras and phones outside (at reception). Especially, you are strictly 
prohibited to take pictures inside the mausoleum. I was there when I was 6th grade. Little did my ten-year-old self
know, I wore a short dress and ended up renting a formal T-shirt and trousers to get in.

    Lying entirely in a well-tended garden, the stilt house was used to be the living place of Uncle Ho from 1958 to
     1969. It is an interpretation of a traditional rural dwelling, and has been kept intact as Uncle Ho left it. 
     In an adjacent building a sign proclaims, ‘Ho Chi Minh’s Used Cars’ – in reality, automobiles he used during 
     his life.

<h4><a class='places' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho%C3%A0n_Ki%E1%BA%BFm_Lake'>Hoan Kiem Lake</a></h4>

<p>Hanoi is well-known as a city of lakes, with the fascinating and historic Hoan Kiem Lake perhaps the most famous.
  This is literally the heart of Hanoi because it is located at one of the most enchanting spots in the city. It also brings a lot of historic values.
<br> Let me give you a little of context here.
It can be said to be the spiritual centerpiece of the capital as the location where, in the 15th century. 
Emperor Le Thai To famously plucked a magical sword from the mouth of a Golden Turtle before leading his troops 
to triumph over the Chinese Ming Dynasty. Legend has it that the turtle told the king to return the sword once the 
invaders were defeated and peace had returned. The king obliged, going back to the lake, unsheathing his sword and 
throwing it to the turtle, hence the name Hoan Kiem – which means Lake of the Returned Sword.

<br>It is widely believed that if you see a turtle rises up at any point, make a wish and your wish will likely become true.
The turtles once in a while rised up and dived back into the lake. There were four turtles down there, but the last one 
passed away two years ago. I was always looking to meet one of them, but it never happened.

<br>If you get to wake up at 6 a.m. in the morning, you would really admire the active and fresh Hanoi that is hard to 
find during the day. I always woke up early back then to grab a bag of sticky rice mixed up with corn and then went back to sleep.

<figcaption style='text-align:center;font-size:15px;padding-top: 15px;'>Historic Hoan Kiem Lake</figcaption>

<br>There are several electric buggy tour routes taking foreign and domestic visitors along 28 streets in the Old 
Quarter, visiting historical sites to give participants an insight into the lives and culture of people in the area. 
For a more leisurely approach, try to rise early and head for the lake, where the morning Tai Chi classes will be in 
full swing. For breakfast try a bowl of Pho Bo (around VND30,000) at Pho Thin, 61 Dinh Tien Hoang street, before a visit to 
the Ngoc Son Temple. You can stop for an iced coffee at the outdoor Hapro Café nearby Le Thai To Street and enjoy the 
rest of the morning.

    <h4><a class='places' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Literature,_Hanoi'>The Temple of Literature</a></h4>

    <p>About 10 km from Hoan Kiem Lake, Temple of Literature (or Văn Miếu Quốc Tử Giám in Vietnamese) seems to be 
      the must-be-included destination in almost trips in Hanoi. Being the first university of Vietnam, the Temple of 
      Literature reveals the study spirit of the Hanoians in the past.

    <br>As an ancient Confucian sanctuary, the Temple of Literature is now considered one of the finest historical, 
    cultural as well as architectural sites in Hanoi. Many visitors coming here are impressed by its special 
    architectural style and the interesting stories behind it. Despite undergoing through lots of restoration works, 
    the Temple of Literature still remains its very first original shape, catching the eyes of all visitors coming here.

    <br>A space of peace, green trees and solemnity covers the whole temple of historical and traditional love for 
    study, making tourists feel like they were lost in a land of Confucion and traditional values. 
    If you are in Hanoi, you should really come and explore it yourself!

        Usually half the original up until you settle the price.

    <h3 id='food'>What to eat?</h3>
    Rather than coffee and sandwiches that can be found anywhere. Hanoi has its unique taste of local dishes that are authentic and very good.
<ul>
  <li>
    Phở: you have probably heard of noodle soup at some point. It is the best of all traditional food in Hanoi. It is said that if 
    you have not tried it when you go to Hanoi, it is equivalent that you have not come there. It is so popular that the first
    thing that comes in mind of anyone when they think of Hanoi is Pho. You can find pho anywhere in the city. To me, it is almost 
    good at any restaurant I stepped into. The price is about $2-4.
  </li>

  <img src='cityImages/pho.jpg' alt='Pho' class='pageImages'>
    <figcaption style='text-align:center;font-size:15px;padding-top: 15px;'>Noodle soup</figcaption>

    <li>Bún chả cá: noodle served with pan fried fish. It is cooked on the table in front of you much like grilled barbecue.
      It is quite tasty. Ask for help when you are there for the first time, the staff will show you how the dish should be eaten
      and how to eat that kind of food. The price is about $2-3.

     <br> Best restaurants: 
     <ul>
       <li>Chả Cá Thăng Long, 21-31 Đuong Thanh street, Cua Đong Ward, Hoan Kiem District</li>
       <li>La Vong Grilled Fish, 14 Cha Ca street, Hang Bo Ward, Hoan Kiem District</li>
       <li>Bun Cha Ta Hanoi, 21 Nguyen Huu Huan street, Hoan Kiem District</li>

    <li>Bún đậu mắm tôm: It is a dish including a stinky sauce and tofu, is a definite must for daredevils undisturbed by the idea of pungent shrimp paste.
        As the name suggests, the dish includes bun (rice vermicelli, usually fresh and served without soup), dau (tofu, usually in crispy brown fried cubes), and mam tom (a smelly shrimp paste that can knock out unprepared foodies on first contact).
        The key to the dish’s success is the magical shrimp paste – the very soul of the delicacy.
        It is served with cucumber slices and an assortment of herbs. The price is about $2-4.

        <br> Best restaurants: 
     <ul>
       <li>Bún đậu mắm tôm Ngõ Trạm, 1B Ngo Tram street, Hoan Kiem District</li>
