Ha Long Bay is the most bustling and busiest hub for tourists. It is the financial center 
as well as the home of big national and international companies. I have lived here for a short year before coming to 
the States. To me, this is a very very special place. I had traveled all my childhood to all places from the North 
down to Da Lat, but I always pushed off to travel to SaiGon when I was little. Not until 2015, I first came there for
jobs and had the best year that I have had. It always posesses a small room in my heart that I will never reserve
for anything else. If you get a chance to live there for couple months, to explore it and blend in with locals, you will
certainly see its pure beauty and the friendly and fun people.
            </p>
<div id='tips'>

<!--   <h3>Before the trip</h3> -->   

<h2>Before the trip</h2>

    <h3 id='language'>Language</h3>
    Official language is Vietnamese. English will be displayed as an alternative, but not often seen. Young people 
    can speak English, since it is the required second language we have to take from elementary school. 
   
    <h3 id='weather'>Weather</h3>
    The weather in Saigon is very nice. It is generally hot, might be a bit of heat-wave at noon and slightly
    chilly when the sky turns swarthy.
    <br>If you are planning to go between June and November, pack an umbrella just in case you need it. There is definitely not
    raining cats and dogs, but might be some shortly irregular rainy afternoon, mostly in August.
    Apparently, winter does not hold true for Saigon. It is just less hot and 
    there might be some raining and breezes sometimes at night.
    
    <h3 id='visitingTime'>Best time to visit</h3>
    
    All year round except for the end of Jaunary and February. It would not be a good time to visit
    because people would usually go home for Tet holiday, and only get back to work at late February. You would not 
    neither see much nor feel the vibes of the city without its people.

    <h3 id='currency'>Currency</h3>

    The currency is Vietnam dong. You will need to exchange cash prior to your arrival. Cards of any kind will not be 
    accepted except in some places like hotels. You would not want to use US dollars because if you purchase something
    for only couple cents, you would not get back the change, so better have Vietnamese dongs in your purse.

    <br>Tips: Please do not exchange a whole lot money at the airport. It is not a win-win option if you compare the rate with other local places.
    If you exchange money for the whole VN trip, get some Vietnam dongs there, and take your cash to either Kim Mai jewelry at 84 Cong Quynh, District 1, HCMC or
    SJC (Saigon Jewelry Joint Stock Company) at 40-42, Phan Boi Chau street, Ben Thanh, District 1, HCMC. They are only
    20 minute walk to Ben Thanh market. A lot of locals exchange to US dollars and other currencies in those shops.

<h2>Arrival</h2>   

    If you arrive by air planes, the Tan Son Nhat international airport will be in the center of the city, so it is quite easy and affordable to 
    grab a regular taxi or a GrabBike to get to the hotel or to your place. Uber is not a common choice. We have an 
    alternative called GrabBike, and it is somewhat cheaper than a regular taxi. 

    <br>If you arrive from another city in Vietnam by bus, Mien Dong Coach Station will be in Binh Thanh district which is 
    30 minute drive from the airport. The fair is way cheaper than the airfair. Be aware that theft happens in all 
    crowded cities around the world; Saigon is no different, so keep an eye on your bags when you are there.

    <br>There are also other bus services of some tourism companies to choose from such as Saigon tourists or Viet travel. 
    They are, in my opinion, will be somewhat pricier but it is safer. 

    <h3 id='accommodation'>Accommodations</h3>

    There are plenty of hotels all over the city. If you stay with Airbnb, stick around the central areas such as 
    District 1, District 3, District 5,Binh Thanh District. If you are looking out for a reliable place, I would suggest
    looking at:

    </ul>
    
    
    <h3 id='trans'>Transportations</h3>
<ul>
      <li> Scooters: you will be overwhelmed by the countless number of scooters we have here in Vietnam. It is the main means
        of transportation. It is really cool to ride a scooter around. It can be rented with a decent price or you can even afford to purchase
        one. However, if you are not brave and risky enough, scooters are not recommended for you to ride it here. Saigon streets
        are very busy and dangerous too. </li> 
          
       <li> GrabBike: cars are more expensive, so GrabBike is scooter operated. It is low-priced, and can be easily shared. 
           You can share a grab car with a local.
        </li>
       <li> Taxi/GrabBike: Taxi is more costly. </li>
      
        <li>Public metros/Buses: not popular. The public transportation here is not developed and utilized. It is hard to 
        get to places.</li>

</ul>
    
    <h3 id='placess'>Where to go?</h3>

    <h4><a class='places' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_1,_Ho_Chi_Minh_City'>1. District 1 </a></h4>

<p>District 1 is the largest and wealthiest neighborhood in HCMC. It attracts a big number of international banks and companies.
    This is also the area where a lot of administrative offices and consulates locate in.
<br>I enjoyed the supermarkets in Japanese and Korean neighborhoods also. There are plenty of them there. It seems like
you see a tiny little Asia in this District.

    <br> This was of course my favorite district that I used to hang out very often when I was there. My favorite street was 
    Nguyen Hue Street. I love walking around with my friends enjoying milk tea and laughing with them. There is
    not much to see at day time, yet it is very busy and fun at night.
